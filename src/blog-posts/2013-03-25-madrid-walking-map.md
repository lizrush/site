Well today I decided to move over the videos from my old youtube account to my regular one that is attached to my real name. Unfortunately that meant two things: 1) I had a compulsion to edit one of the videos before I could upload it again and 2) I lost my view counts. I mean, it was only a couple of hundred views, but now that the count is back at zero it’s a bit disheartening.

Anyway, here’s the new version of my madrid walking map- a series of photos that mark where i walked everyday for three months in the summer of 2011:
