For the past six months, I have been working on my new "work hobby", [Perpetually Busty](http://perpetuallybusty.tumblr.com/), a repurposed comic strip that I rewrite with the help of my favorite coworker, [Amanda Flagg](http://amandaflagg.net).

Now the zine version of all our online strips (plus a thrilling conclusion) [is available](http://lizmrush.bigcartel.com/product/perpetually-busty) for purchase! We have finally complied all the strips into a 22-page zine with color covers. Each strip is cut out of the newspaper, the speech bubbles are filled with whiteout and the dialog is rewritten.

Only \$5, so [snag a copy](http://lizmrush.bigcartel.com/product/perpetually-busty) while they're hot!
