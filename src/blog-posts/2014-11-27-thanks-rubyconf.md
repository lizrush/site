This Thanksgiving I wanted to give a special shout-out to those who donated to our indiegogo campaign, [RubyConf or Bust!](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rubyconf-or-bust/x/4703068), which enabled Hsing-Hui and me to get down to San Diego earlier this month for our talk.

Thanks to extra donations and generous co-attendees who bought me macarons, margaritas, & armfuls of late-night candy, I came in under budget by \$130. Today I donated that amount to the fantastic organization [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com)!

If you missed the thank you slides in our talk, here's a list of the companies that paid for "corporate sponsorship" of our talk as well as a partial list of the individuals who contributed to our campaign. You can also check out my experience at RubyConf in [this blog post](http://lizmrush.com/conference-recap-2014-speaker-notes/). We wouldn't have been able to get there without each and every one of you!
